# FoodQ
A restaurant queuing application for a subject course I took in 2021.
The purpose of the subject was to create a product/service that helps individuals during the trying times of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The application's goal is to replace physical queues with virtual ones. To eliminate the ambiguity of queuing waiting time and enhancing the new norm of SOP practices and social distancing. 

The Figma link is the design concept of the application.
